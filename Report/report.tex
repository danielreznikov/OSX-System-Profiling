\begin{abstract}
The characteristic meta-challenge of profiling Computer Systems is the ability to isolate system components, control dependencies and optimizations, and to conduct well-defined, repeatable experimentation. The goal of this project is profile the OSX Operation System.

\section{Introduction}
We seek to measure the performance of our PC system components including CPU, RAM, disk and the network. We implement the supporting experimentation code in the language C as it is low-level enough to allow us to control for many system optimization, and at times to execute raw X86 Assembly instructions.

Our team members contribute equally to each part of the project. For each milestone, we would walk-through the design of each experiment together, and implement equal parts individually. We use Github for source control.
