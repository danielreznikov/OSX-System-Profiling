File Read Time Predictions

10 GB/1 = 4kb/x  # 10GB/s is RAM Bandwidth

10 kb/us = 4kb/x

x * 10kb = 4kb

x = 4kb / 10kb

x = 0.4us # time to read a block in memory

-----
# 220 micro seconds is page fault time
(220 + 7  * 50.4) / 8 = 71.6
(220 + 15 * 50.4) / 16 = 61
(220 + 31 * 50.4) / 32 = 55.7
(220 + 63 * 50.4) / 64 = 53.05
